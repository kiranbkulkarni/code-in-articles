TITLE: Fixed-effects model: An intercept model with two mixtures
DATA:	FILE IS hox.txt;	
VARIABLE: NAMES d varofd inter weeks;
	USEVARIABLES ARE d inter;
	CLASSES=c(2);			! Define two classes of mixtures
DEFINE: w2 = SQRT(varofd**(-1));
	d = w2*d;
	inter = w2*inter;
ANALYSIS: TYPE=MIXTURE;			! Use mixture analysis
	STARTS 200 20;			! Use 200 random starting values
	STITERATIONS = 20;
MODEL:			           
	%OVERALL%			! Overall model
	[d@0.0];			! Intercept is fixed at 0
	d@1.0;				! Error variance is fixed at 1
	d ON inter;			! Weighted mean of the 1st mixture

	%c#2%				! Second mixture
	d ON inter;			! Weighted mean of the 2nd mixture
