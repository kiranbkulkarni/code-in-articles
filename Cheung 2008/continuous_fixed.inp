TITLE: Fixed-effects model: A Continuous covariate
DATA:	FILE IS hox.txt;	
VARIABLE: NAMES d varofd inter weeks;
	USEVARIABLES ARE d inter weeks;
DEFINE: w2 = SQRT(varofd**(-1));	
	d = w2*d;
	inter = w2*inter;
	weeks = w2*weeks;		! Transformed weeks
MODEL:	
	d ON inter weeks;
	[d@0.0];			! Intercept is fixed at 0
	d@1.0;				! Error variance is fixed at 1
OUTPUT: SAMPSTAT;
