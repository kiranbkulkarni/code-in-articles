TITLE: Random-effects model (with ML method): A continuous covariate
DATA:	FILE IS hox.txt;	
VARIABLE: NAMES d varofd inter weeks;
	USEVARIABLES ARE d inter weeks;
DEFINE: w2 = SQRT(varofd**(-1));
	d = w2*d;
	inter = w2*inter;
	weeks = w2*weeks;
ANALYSIS: TYPE=RANDOM;			! Use random slope analysis
MODEL:	
	[d@0.0];			! Intercept is fixed at 0
	d@1.0;				! Error variance is fixed at 1
	u | d ON inter;
	d ON weeks;
	u*;				! var(u): tau^2
   	[u*];				! mean(u): intercept
OUTPUT: SAMPSTAT;
