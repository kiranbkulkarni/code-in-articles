TITLE: Fixed-effects model: Missing data on the covariate (FIML)
! FIML is the default option started from Mplus Version 5
DATA:	FILE IS hox_miss.txt;		! Data file with missing values	
VARIABLE: NAMES d varofd inter weeks;
	USEVARIABLES ARE d inter weeks;
	MISSING ARE ALL (999);		! Define missing values
DEFINE: w2 = SQRT(varofd**(-1));	
	d = w2*d;
	inter = w2*inter;
	weeks = w2*weeks;		! Transformed weeks
MODEL:						            
	d ON inter weeks;
	[d@0.0];			! Intercept is fixed at 0
	d@1.0;				! Error variance is fixed at 1
OUTPUT: SAMPSTAT;
