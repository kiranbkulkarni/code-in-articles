TITLE:	Fixed-effects model: Missing data on the covariate (listwise deletion)
DATA:	FILE IS hox_miss.txt;
	LISTWISE = ON;			! Use listwise deletion	
VARIABLE: NAMES d varofd inter weeks;
	USEVARIABLES ARE d inter weeks;
	MISSING ARE ALL (999);		! Define missing values
DEFINE: w2 = SQRT(varofd**(-1));	
	d = w2*d;
	inter = w2*inter;
	weeks = w2*weeks;		! Transformed weeks
MODEL:			            
	d ON inter weeks;
	[d@0.0];			! Intercept is fixed at 0
	d@1.0;				! Error variance is fixed at 1
OUTPUT: SAMPSTAT;
