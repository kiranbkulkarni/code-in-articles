TITLE: Fixed-effects model: An intercept model with Q statistic and heterogeneity indices
! Wald approach
DATA:	FILE IS hox.txt;		! Data are transformed
VARIABLE: NAMES d varofd inter weeks;
	USEVARIABLES ARE d inter;
DEFINE: w2 = SQRT(varofd**(-1));
	d = w2*d;
	inter = w2*inter;
MODEL:			            
	d ON inter;
	[d@0.0];			! Intercept is fixed at 0
	d (p1);				! Estimated error variance
MODEL CONSTRAINT:
	NEW(Q_stat H2_stat I2_stat);
	Q_stat = 20*p1;			! Q statistic
	H2_stat = Q_stat/19;		! H2 indice
	I2_stat = 1-19/Q_stat;		! I2 indice
OUTPUT: SAMPSTAT;        
	CINTERVAL(symmetric); 	! Wald CI
