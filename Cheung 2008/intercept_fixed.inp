TITLE: Fixed-effects model: An intercept model
DATA:	FILE IS hox.txt;
VARIABLE: NAMES d varofd inter weeks;
	USEVARIABLES ARE d inter;
DEFINE: w2 = SQRT(varofd**(-1));	! Weight for the transformation
	d = w2*d;			! Transformed d
	inter = w2*inter;		! Transformed intercept
MODEL:			            
	d ON inter;
	[d@0.0];			! Intercept is fixed at 0
	d@1.0;				! Error variance is fixed at 1
OUTPUT: SAMPSTAT;
